{\em
Networks have policies in place to ensure efficient and fair resource 
utilization and protection of network installations. An effective monitoring and
countering mechanism needs a complete picture of resource protection and utilization 
,by monitoring network traffic and diverse activity logs, in order to act on time. 

netscout is a python based network filtering, monitoring and countering mechanism driven by
policies. Traffic is observed in real time, largely in a passive mode, and past and current user/host 
activity information is used to make decisions about future traffic monitoring. 
Such a 'predictive' model allows efficient information gathering and subsequent appropriate responses.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{figure}

\caption{A typical university network topology}
\label{fig:nwTopo}
\end{figure}

Consider a typical university network, Figure~\ref{fig:nwTopo}, with interconnected
residential (resnet), academic and hostel networks. Connection to the Internet is via
one or many router(s) and proxy server(s). The router(s), running netscout\cite{netscout}, act as vantage points to
monitor and control network traffic. LDAP logins (Proxy authentication) (if used) can be determined via
netscout and be used in addition to HOST IP based information gathering to build user/host network activity profile. 
In order to maximize the efficiency of netscout to present 
relevant information, the application should run on one or many of the routers(s) to 
monitor internal and outgoing traffic, via the proxy server. netscout can be employed in a 
topology wherein traffic from the main router(s) is also directed 
to another machine (akin to a t-junction) running netscout. netscout, in position now to 
monitor network traffic can filter, counter 'hostile' traffic and generate user desired 
reports for further analysis and action.

\section{the netscout advantage}
The strength of netscout lies is the ability to employ some 'intelligence' in packet gathering. As LANs
tend to generate huge amounts of traffic the network data sample should be small but useful. An approach where 
a sample of network data is gathered, sans any filters, the probability of finding useful information is
proportional to the data size. A large data size though tends to slow down further processing. For example,
consider (a) 1000 packets captured and P2P (peer-to-peer) packets looked for in them or (b) looking only for a threshold 
level of P2P packets. As evident, case (b) is more efficient as the data set captured contains relevant information 
and also the threshold levels decided by the user allows the user to control the number of P2P hosts he
intends to discover.  

netscout also tries to obtain a logical picture of the network activity. For example, once netscout has ascertained
that a host is involved in P2P activity it then tries to (if activated) obtain the proxy user id being used
from that host. This is done by looking at a couple of http packets. The proxy user component now
allows netscout to build network profile of a user. 

Hosts added to netscout's database via static keyword matching techniques (say P2P), slowly form the
database for the future. For instance, hosts identified as involved in P2P activities are first
checked for their http traffic. Websites accessed by hosts are stored and classified. The classification
involves looking at keywords in the website's meta section. If website is found to be
violating policy then, a further detailed analysis of the host network activity is done in order to 
ascertain if the host accesses too many policy violating websites. Furthermore, hosts accessing websites classified
as policy violating are monitored for there network activity. 
In addition to keyword matching techniques few statistical techniques too are employed for traffic monitoring.
Parameters such as bandwidth usage and high connections help identify potential network bottlenecks and
possible policy violating traffic.
In essence, netscout tries to maximize network information in the smallest gathering and processing time.

 
\section{netscout internals}
netscout is a python based network filtering, monitoring and countering mechanism. The 
packet gathering is largely done via existing tools such as ngrep\cite{ngrep},tcpdump\cite{tcpdump}
and tshark\cite{tshark}. The gathered data is then analysed and acted upon based on the network policies
laid out in the netscout configuration file, which drive the application. 
Currently, netscout can monitor and detect:  
(1) unauthorized  P2P (DC++), (2) policy violating HTTP traffic, (3) MAC address spoofing, 
(4) heavy bandwidth usage and (5) 'hostile' traffic against important network resources. 
The information is persisted in a SQLite database for basing future activity monitoring and 
reporting user/host network activity.
netscout has five modes of operation: {\bf passive}, {\bf protect}, {\bf counter}, {\bf update} and {\bf report} modes.
These modes can be activated/deactivated via the following "config" file parameters
\fbox{\begin{tabular}{p{7cm}}
\#\# Set to true to check for DC++ p2p traffic\\
dcppMode=false\\

\#\# Set to true to check for http traffic\\
httpMode=true\\

\#\# Set to true to do statistical analysis\\
statMode=false\\

\#\# Set to true to protect important resources (proxy,mail) \\
protectMode=false\\

\#\# Set to true to counter offending hosts\\
counterMode=false\\
\end{tabular}}


\section{Passive Mode}
The primary data gathering mode of netscout. Here traffic is listened on to specified interface and data
obtained based on the configuration file. Based on the configuration the kind of traffic requested (eg http,p2p) 
to be monitored is heard for. Also, statistical parameters like maximum number of connections to, bandwidth
usage are computed based on the thresholds decided in the configuration. Sample session on netscout invoked in
passive mode on the eth0 interface.

\section*{P2P (DC++)}
Peer-to-peer shares\cite{dcpp} tend to generate lot of network traffic and create potential 
network bottlenecks. In addition to the large network volumes generated, it is the potential copyright infringement 
that P2P hubs can be used for that causes a need to monitor them. Also, not all P2P shares generate lot of
traffic or indulge in copyright infringement, those can be identified by analysing the bandwidth usages
, files hosted.  

netscout can identify hubs and clients operating in  a network without requiring prior knowledge of
such hosts and the need to connect to central peer hubs to obtain information. Working in a passive mode
and armed with keyword matching and protocol information, netscout can identify peers and also the files
shared and traded by peers. Based on the results netscout can form a database for future runs and attempt
to identify P2P hubs with more efficiency.  
The number of HUBS to be looked for can be controlled by setting the following appropriate configuration parameters:

\fbox{\begin{tabular}{p{7cm}}
\#\# Number of MyINFO packets to look for (ie number of HUBS to locate)\\
myinfo=18\\
\#\# Number of Search Results packets to look for (to get file list)\\
sr=26\\
\#\# Number of HUB-Client Packets to look for\\
hubClient=15
\end{tabular}}

\section*{HTTP}
The type and kind of websites allowed access are driven by policies. Hence, monitoring the kind of
websites being accessed by a user/host gives insight into the future potential activity of the user/host.
Proxies generally hold black or white lists, determined by policies, to control Internet access. 
netscout, instead of such a static technique, uses keyword matching techniques to classify a website. The
classification is done by looking for keywords only the {\bf head} section containing the
meta and title information, instead of scanning a complete page. 
It has been found that few lines of text of the head section are sufficient in most cases to classify the website.
The categorization is based on the category-keyword pairs as decided by the policy. A user/host accessing
websites that violate policy is assumed to do so in the future too and subsequent runs for netscout 
keep that in mind when filtering traffic. This automated classification also allows now to identify unlisted
websites and keeping the website access lists updated. 

\section*{MAC spoofing}
MAC spoofing often forms the backbone of malicious attacks and detecting it can go a long way
in thwarting potential future attacks. netscout, in each run, captures the MAC address of the active hosts. The MAC
thus obtained is compared when the host is active again in subsequent runs of netscout.  
Deviations from past history are reported.

\section*{OS Fingerprinting}
netscout uses the lightweight passive OS fingerprinting expertise of {\bf p0f} \cite{p0f}. Once potential policy 
violating hosts have been identified, netscout tries to garner more information about them. p0f allows
an efficient way to learn the OS make of the host allowing better response to threats.   
 
\section*{Bandwidth usage}
Bandwidth usage monitoring goes in a long way to ensure fair and efficient usage of
network resources. netscout explicitly looks at P2P traffic utilizing protocol information,
but can also detect traffic bottlenecks. In this case, bandwidth usage of hosts is computed
and those high on the list are probed more to obtain information about the type of traffic
flowing through them. Another indicator is to look for number of destination connections 
terminating at a host. Hosts exhibiting high values of incoming connections are also probed
for their traffic types and patterns. This way services like LAN multiplayer games, streaming servers 
may be identified without specifically looking for them.

\fbox{\begin{tabular}{p{7cm}}
\#\# number of packets to look for connections terminating on a host in order to raise alarm\\ 
connTo = 50\\
\#\# minimum number of connections terminating on a host in order to raise alarm \\
connToMin = 20\\
\#\# ignore activity to and from this host. eg, a proxy server \\
ignoreHost = proxy.local.ac\\
\end{tabular}}


\section{Protect Mode}
A major goal of information filtering is to use it to protect important resources.
Mail, Proxy, academic servers, to name a few, need to be protected from internal threats. netscout
monitors the activity to specified important resources and alerts system administrators
of deviations from the norm. In addition activity from identified 'rouge' hosts is controlled 
(bandwidth throttling) via firewall rules (IPTABLES).

\fbox{\begin{tabular}{p{7cm}}
\#\# Network resources that need to be protected\\
impRes = proxy.local.ac, smtp.local.ac\\
\#\# number of packets to look for connections terminating on important hosts \\
prConnTo = 50\\
\#\# minimum number of connections terminating on a host in order to raise alarm \\
prConnToMin = 20\\
\end{tabular}}

\section{Counter Mode}
Once a threat or bandwidth hoarder is identified steps can be taken to limit the damage. 
netscout is able to either control bandwidth output from hosts or completely block them from 
network access for a pre-defined time duration. Also, if the proxy authentication from the
host is determined then e-mails can be sent to warn users about their actions. 

\section{Update Mode}

In the update mode netscout looks to improve on previous and add new web categorizations based on the 
category and keywords pertaining to it, as specified by the configuration file. 
The website categorization exercise is completely automated and can be carried out, if required,
independently during low network traffic hours. 
netscout can either update unclassified websites or all websites (classified
or unclassified) based on the category-keyword pairs as defined. The results of the website categorization 
may be reviewed, and if required, corrected by authorized personnel.  
\fbox{\begin{tabular}{p{7cm}}
\#\# Enter name value pairs of categories and keywords \\
Adult = sex,porn\\
Video = video,stream\\
SocialNetworking = friends,network,meet\\
News = news\\
\end{tabular}}

\section{Report Mode}
After a netscout run has finished the information collected can be retrieved via the report mode.
The report mode prints out a user/host wise display of network activity in a specified time period.
\fbox{\begin{tabular}{p{7cm}}
\#netscout -r\\

\end{tabular}}
