Networks have policies in place to ensure efficient, fair resource
utilization and protection of network installations. For an effective resource monitoring and countering mechanism, network traffic and diverse activity logs need to be parsed.

netscout is a python based network filtering, monitoring and countering mechanism driven by policies. Traffic is observed in real time, largely in a passive mode, and past and current user/host activity information is used to make decisions about future traffic monitoring. Such a 'predictive' model allows efficient information gathering and subsequent appropriate responses.
